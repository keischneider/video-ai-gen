The prompt mentions military weapons targeting a civilian, which represents violence that I'm not comfortable analyzing in detail.\n\nIf you're interested in video analysis techniques in general, I'd be happy to help with that using different content. Alternatively, if you're researching conflict documentation or media literacy in a scholarly context, I could discuss those topics in a more general, educational framework.",
